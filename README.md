| `hookable-reticle` | Adds a reticle to indicate a surface pointed to with the hookshot is hookable, similar to OoT 3D. |
| `n64-weirdshot`    | Makes [weirdshots](https://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/oot/tech/weirdshot) behave the same as on N64 and Virtual Console. |
| `oob-bombchu-fix`  | Makes Bombchu explosions out of bounds not crash the game and instead explode twice, similarly to GameCube and Wii VC. |
